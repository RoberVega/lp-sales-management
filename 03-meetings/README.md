# Meetings


Management has to be adapted to the person you are managing / selling and this means that you need to learn to read the room.

## Reading the room

You need to focus on reading the motivations from all the people in the room, and every person might have a different interpretation of you from the beginning, specially when working in a consulting firm:

- Some people from the company might see us as a threat if they failed on a task that you are being called to help on

- Some people might see you as a solution to their problem

- Some of them might be even wondering why they are in that meeting

and your job is to make all these people happy about the situation. But there is a tricky part, you need to be sincere.

## Delivering truths

It is a very subtle thing to be sincere without getting people in a defensive mood. You need to avoid this!

And how can you do this? By delivering facts, specific situations in which the client did not fulfil their end of the deal, but also by taking responsibility if you did something wrong on your part. And be TRANSPARENT.

## Give importance to logs

In order to deliver truths and have uncomfortable conversations with clients you need to have a very structured idea:
- Read the logs
- Determine what you did wrong
- Determine what the client did wrong
- Determine what was inevitable
- Talk with specifics
- BE TRANSPARENT
