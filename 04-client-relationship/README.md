# Client Relationship


## Give regular feedback

You need to regularly (this might be daily, weekly) give feedback to the client. Allow them to know what your struggles are, give them a status. And why is this? Because a tiny improvement in the right direction is much better than no improvement at all.

The more you give them status in a sensible time scale, the better they will feel.


## Take them for a meal and listen to them

Once in a while, you can take responsibles to have lunch and your mission is to get to know about them, how they are doing. But also, ask about what they struggle with within the company, their personal and company challenges they are facing.
