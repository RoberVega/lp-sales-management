# The ABC of sales: Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity

The original pinacle of sales used to be _Always Be Closing_. This perspective is associated to more pressuring selling techniques. In _To Sell is Human_, the author Daniel Pink tries to redefine this ABC to account for the new standards in sales. We will explore each of these concepts and let you with an interview in which the author himself summarizes his ideas. 

## Attunement

The essence of influencing others today lies in the essential skill of perspective-taking. This skill, known as attunement, is the process of aligning one's behavior and mindset with others and the specific situation at hand, similar to empathising, but with a a stronger influence from rationality.

Imagine it as fine-tuning a radio station. It involves the skill to navigate through various frequencies based on the need of the hour, ensuring that one is in sync with the ongoing communications, even when the messages aren't instantly apparent or are hidden between the lines.


### 1. Gain influence by seeming less powerful.

This concept suggests that there is a contrasting correlation between authority and the ability to take on another's perspective. Holding too much control can misalign you from the right frequency, causing interference that distorts clear transmissions and hides the nuanced ones.

### 2. Use your head as much as your heart.

The second principle of attunement stresses the importance of balancing intellectual understanding with emotional intelligence. Insights from various social studies highlight that individuals who employ empathy are more successful in reaching agreements than those who do not. However, those who utilize perspective-taking excel even further.

This principle underlines the notion that individuals are not isolated entities but are part of larger networks involving groups, situations, and contexts. Effectively engaging with others involves not just understanding individuals but also their interrelationships and the dynamics of their networks.

Understanding the preferences and biases of all the people in the room is fundamental. This mental mapping, or social cartography, is a strategic exercise in ensuring that efforts are directed towards the right people within an organization's hierarchy, preventing wasted time and increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes. It is this deep dive into the interpersonal intricacies of a business environment that can distinguish a successful endeavor from a futile one.

### 3. Mimic strategically

Skilled negotiators often employ the technique of mirroring the body language of their counterpart to foster a better rapport and consequently, secure more favorable terms. This could mean subtly emulating gestures such as a face touch or mirroring the posture, whether it's leaning in or reclining. The key to this tactic is subtlety; it should go unnoticed, or it might have an adverse effect. Moreover, while mirroring can be beneficial, it should not come at the expense of losing focus on the negotiation's objectives. One must strike a balance between an unobtrusive mimicry and steadfast concentration on the negotiation at hand.

In addition to body language, the power of touch can also play a pivotal role, albeit it must be used judiciously. A reassuring handshake, a light pat on the back, or other culturally appropriate gestures can create a connection and a sense of trust. However, this must always be applied with awareness of personal boundaries and social norms to ensure it is received positively.


> Note: Interestingly, research on sales performance reveals that it's not the extroverts or introverts who excel, but the ambiverts—those whose personalities are a blend of both introversion and extroversion. Ambiverts, who hover around the middle of the introversion-extraversion scale, demonstrate an optimal balance that appears to enable them to connect more effectively with a wider range of individuals, thus outperforming their purely introverted or extroverted peers in generating revenue. This suggests that in negotiation and sales, flexibility and the ability to modulate one's approach to suit the social context are invaluable assets.



## Buoyancy

Buoyancy is about how to stay afloat in the ocean of rejection that sales encompases. There are three components—which apply before, during, and after any effort to move others.

### 1. Before: Interrogative Self-Talk

The most effective type of self-talk is interrogative. Basically start asking yourself questions about what you are going to try. And why is that? Well, there are two main reasons. 

- First, the interrogative, by its very form,
elicits answers—and within those answers are strategies for actually carrying out the task. 

Imagine, for instance, that you’re readying yourself
for an important meeting in which you must pitch an idea. If you ask, “Can I make a great pitch?” it prompts you to summon the reasons, resources and
strategies to actually accomplish the task. You might think about last time and try to correct some mistakes, or you may remember how you planed to deal with certain person that is hard to convince.

- Interrogative self-talk can also remind you of your personal goals behind it, and with personal goals people will naturally be more motivated. 

### 2. During: Positivity Ratios

Bringing negative emotions into people propel their behavior toward survival in the moment, fly or fight instincts. By contrast, positive emotions broaden people’s ideas about possible actions, opening people to collaboration and more receptive to being moved.

Positivity has one other important dimension when it comes to moving others. You have to believe in the product you’re selling—and that has to show. 

### 3. After: Explanatory Style

Think of explanatory style as a form of self-
talk that occurs after (rather than before) an experience. It has to be an optimistic explanatory style—you need to see rejections as temporary rather than permanent, specific rather than
universal, and external rather than personal. That way you will grow, define a different strategy and not as a definite loss.

## Clarity 

Clarity is the capacity to help others see their situations in fresh and more revealing ways and to identify problems they didn’t realize they had.

This needs of a change of mentality: we need to move from problem _solvers_ to problem _finders_. In the era of information, finding solutions does not have as much value as finding problems, at least in what sales is concerned.

Clarity depends on contrast. We often understand something better when we see it in comparison with something else. That is why we care so much about metrics and how to properly measurable actions. Numbers have limited applictions and we need to learn to contrast intuitively, but they are extremely accurate, so try to prioritize them.  

A crucial point is to ask good questions and you can work on this following simple steps. Before an important meeting:

1. **Produce your questions**: Generate a list of questions without stopping to judge, discuss, or answer any of them. 
2. **Improve your questions**: Go through your list of questions and categorize each one as either "yes/no" questions or “open-ended”. Then, looking over the two types of questions, strategically modify the proper yes/no questions to open-ended and vice-versa.
3. **Prioritize your questions**: Choose your three most important questions. Think about why you chose
them. Then edit them one more time so they are ultra-clear.


Through this process you can identify a trio of powerful questions that you can ask the person on the other side of the table. And those questions can help both of you clarify where you are and where you should be going.


## Summarizing

Here we leave you with an interview to the author of the book _To Sell is Human_, Daniel Pink, where these ideas come from. In it, he will summarize the book in a 20-minute interview.
